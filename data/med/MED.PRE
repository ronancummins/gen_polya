early infantile psychosis the symbiotic and autistic syndromes conclusion wish state that the core child psychosis must sought one the other the described distortions the sym- biotic phase the first case what lay the heart the psychotic dis- turbance was the marked emotional unavailability the mother which alternated with purely physical extreme closeness during the breast-feeding situations and particularly with the destructiveness the mothers unpredictable rage attacks the contrasting experiences drove the child the autistic warding off any human contact and the de-animation the world reality constitutional factors could not this case evaluated with any degree accuracy the second case was contrast the mothers ever-presence that created unendurable instrusion upon and interference with the structuralization the budding ego which constitutionally and perhaps predispositionally may have been very vulnerable this made impossible for the infant experience the normal alternation the gratification-frustration sequences his own pace; also made the process individuation the separation-individuation period one which was beset with abysmal panic both instances can see that was primarily the severe dis- tortions the normal symbiosis that the child psychosis had its roots

immunological demonstration factor viii protein the plasma hemophiliacs and its value for insight into hemophilia immunization rabbits one obtains antisera against human factor viii the action the immunsera has been determined using modification the thromboplastingenerations test the factor viii neutralization test the antibodies against factor viii are equally absorbed either normal hemophilia plasma this observation shows that hemophilia plasma contains much factor viii protein normal plasma does normal and hemophilia serum one finds lower level similar concentrations factor viii analogy with cross-reacting substances crm bacteria mutants hypothesis has been made according which the authors are dealing with the product genetically altered synthesis factor viii this product functionally less active but possesses the same antigenic determinants the normal factor viii some inhibitor properties the hemophilia plasma can explained competitive inhibition made possible the similarity structure the fact that the inhibitor discovered mammen and factor viii have similar properties support the hypothesis the theory some authors according which the plasma hemophiliac contains normal amounts normal factor viii blocked specific inhibitor the pathogenetic agent hemophilia rejected because genetic considerations and because the accelerator appearing after ether treatment hemophilia plasma not identical with factor viii 
haemophilic pseudotumours cases the first cases haemophilic pseudo-tumours adults affected with haemophilia reported are remarkable account their clinical latency and their intertrochanteric localization the third haemophiliac very extensive and accompanied very marked clinical symptoms tumour there extensive femoral gap with subjacent image osseous infarction and progressive turgid tumour the iliac wing the same side the literature data stress the discrepancy between the progressive character this veritable tumour and the absence any sign histological malignancy 
protein-losing enteropathy complicating prolonged bleeding hemophilia gastrointestinal bleeding severe hemophiliac continued for days and pints fresh blood were replaced treatment with eaca steroids and factor viii rich fibrinogen did not control bleeding marked hypoproteinemia developed the day bleeding protein-losing enteropathy was suspected the basis x-ray findings mucosal thickening and altered motility discontinuance steroids and protein replacement resulted the appearance more normal small bowel mucosal pattern and coincided with the cessation bleeding 
bilateral hemophilic pseudotumors the calcaneus and cuboid treated irradiation case report case presented which bilateral pseudotumors the calcaneus and cuboid -year-old boy with apparent classic hemophilia responded promptly deep x-ray therapy with relief pain and subsequent disappearance the tumors without recurrence for and mth after treatment although previous reports the effects radiotherapy for pseudotumors have been conflicting the results this case were dramatic 
some bone lesions the course blood diseases with special reference the formation bony callus and the treatment fractures patients suffering from blood diseases after some preliminary remarks the embryology and physiology the bone marrow and the mechanism coagulation the blood the authors pass consideration the genesis bony callus and the treatment fractures patients suffering from blood diseases account given the basis some examples pathological fractures and also some traumatic fractures subjects affected various kinds blood diseases such solitary myeloma polyosteotic plasmocytoma waldenstroems syndrome the coagulopathic syndrome from structural defect the fibrin coagulum and hemophilia fractures patients with blood diseases are characterized abnormal course and for effecient cure necessary make accurate diagnosis with regard the pre-existing blood diseases and re-establish hemostasis when this has been changed prevent hemorrhages and correct any plasma defect that may present and which are reflected the formation the bony callus 
studies the antihemophilic factor ahf factor viii produced von willebrands disease has been confirmed that persons with autosomal ahf deficiency von willebrands disease produce large quantities ahf when transfused with ahf-deficient plasma from persons with hemophilia this occurs despite the fact that complementation does not occur vitro one prediction from model suggesting that the x-locus for ahf structural while the autosomal locus regulatory that the ahf which appears von willebrands disease after transfusion will structurally normal the ahf obtained under these conditions has been tested methods and the results fulfil the prediction this may imply that the model correct the other hand the prediction may have been fulfilled for other reasons perhaps the wrong parameters were examined the large standard errors the tests masked real difference further tests are obviously needed before one can feel reasonably certain that mutation regulatory gene the basis von willebrands disease examination persons with sex-linked and autosomal ahf deficiency using antibody prepared against wild type ahf might very illuminating also transfusion studies should carried out persons homozygous for von willebrands disease such persons can found failure obtain new synthesis homozygote would throw great doubt model which implies that the reduced ahf levels von willebrands disease heterozygotes due entirely reduction effector substance which neutralizes the repressor x-chromosome operon directly coding the ahf molecule 
tumor-like bone lesions hemophilia this report deals with the clinical and radiologic findings hemophilic pseudotumor the femur observed over period the pathogenesis treatment and radiologic differential diagnosis are discussed 
concurrent hemophilia and christmas disease one family study presented number generations family whom two members had christmas disease and three hemophilia suspected that the preceding generations must have been afflicted with hemophilia mutation x-chromosome genes which are responsible for both types hemophilia must have occurred the grandmothers family her daughters the genes responsible for hemophilia segregated that their children and grandchildren inherited only one type hemophilia hemophilia christmas disease relevant genetic considerations are briefly reviewed 
albinism associated with angiohemophilia report case case presented rare association albinism and angiohemophilia occurring man the bone marrow contained cells resembling proper reticulum cells and containing large basophilic granules 
major surgery classic hemophilia using fraction experience twelve operations and review the literature therapeutic regimen that provides hemostasis hemophiliacs during and after major surgery without requiring laboratory control has been established with factor viii concentrate the effectiveness this regimen fraction therapy was evaluated major surgery severely deficient and moderately deficient hemophiliacs analysis clinical results was made combining the operations the series with the major operative procedures hemophiliacs recorded the english literature which fraction was the sole major source factor viii therapy dental and nondental surgery were analyzed separately was the special problem blood cysts although the over-all mortality rate following major surgery hemophiliacs presently only using factor viii concentrates problems still remain these include the continued high incidence abnormal postoperative hemorrhage the variation factor viii potency different lots fraction the late development serum hepatitis hemolytic anemia due contaminating isoantibodies and the high cost adequate amounts the product more efficient methods preparing purer and more potent factor viii concentrates could eliminate most these difficulties 
lengthening the thrombin time anti-equine antithrombin hyperthrombocyte myelosis report given patient treated with numerous injections thrombase equine thrombin for chronic gingivorrhagia caused hyperthrombocytic myelosis these were ineffective and antithrombin specific against equine thrombin had developed this did not cause any specific disturbance the intrinsic coagulation the observation can compared with two cases haemophilia where such antithrombin had also developed after repeated injections equine thrombin 
epsilon-aminocaproic acid e-aca therapeutic agent based years clinical experience experience the treatment patients with e-aca suggested that the use the preparation indicated the following situations fibrinolytic haemorrhage association with delivery acute systemic fibrinolysis association with surgery mainly major operations the thorax pancreas prostate liver and genital organs that are complicated fibrinolysis but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur after any operation acute systemic fibrinolysis patients with cancer particularly cancer the prostate and pancreas systemic fibrinolytic states complicating various disorders especially leukaemia liver cirrhosis and boecks sarcoid antidote thrombolytic therapy local fibrinolytic activity the urinary tract the following situations after prostatectomy e-aca will substantially reduce blood losses following prostatectomy especially the treatment continued until the urine has become macroscopically clear haematuria prostatic cancer prostatic hyperplasia prolonged haematuria after traumatic injury the kidney haematuria haemophilia and other coagulation defects and so-called essential haematuria ulcerative colitis the drug equally effective whether given orally intravenously states with increased systemic fibrinolytic activity dose per body weight every hours recommended for inhibition local fibrinolytic activity the urinary tract dose three times day has proved sufficient the side-effects consisted dizziness nausea and diarrhoea toxic effects the drug ecg blood picture npn and liver function tests were observed not even cases receiving more than e-aca nor did postmortem examination cases reveal any signs toxic effect signs intravascular coagulation connection with e-aca therapy were observed the incidence thromboembolic complications after prostatectomy patients treated with e-aca and series controls was identical judging from the authors experience this material e-aca did not act agent inducing thrombosis 
femoral neuropathy hemophilia six new cases femoral neuropathy hemophilic patients are described the syndrome begins with severe pain the groin the inferior aspect the thigh and deep the hip region this followed pronounced contracture the hip flexion and external rotation tender swelling appears the iliac fossa and groin with depression the center corresponding the inguinal ligament finally flaccid paralysis the quadriceps femoris and diminution absence sensation the anteromedial aspect the thigh and proximal portion the leg with depressed absent patellar reflex discovered the authors propose that this syndrome the result hemorrhage the iliopsoas muscle the musculotendinous junction beneath the iliacus fascia and that the femoral nerve becomes compressed beneath the unyielding inguinal ligament superiorly and the iliopectineal ligament medially treatment consists bed rest analgesics and freshfrozen plasma during the acute phase during the convalescent phase hessing long brace used protect the knee from hemarthrosis until functional return the quadriceps femoris has occurred date the validity the theory that the femoral-nerve palsy the result iliopsoas hemorrhage the musculotendinous junction and compression the femoral nerve beneath the inguinal ligament has not been verified the authors anticipate some day seeing non-hemophilic patient with traumatic iliacus hemorrhage and femoral neuropathy should such opportunity present itself exploration beneath pouparts ligament may show the femoral nerve compressed and thus confirm the proposed cause the clinical picture 
hemorrhagic episodes hemophilia -year prospective study medicosocial studies hemophilia are particular clinical importance allowing assessment the likely course the disease different ages and for differing grades severity and providing knowledge which complications cause the most disability loss education and earning capacity they also overcome the distorted clinical impression the disease which arises from the recurrent admission the same few severely affected hemophiliacs owing the considerable individual variation the number and severity complications different hemophiliacs accurate individual prognosis can never given general however the number spontaneous episodes per year decreases with age while the severity individual episodes tends increase least until the age there general agreement that the bulk hospital hemophilic admissions are due hemarthroses and that hemophilic arthropathy involves the knee more than does any other joint the increased time spent hospital per episode later life part least due the development relatively unstable weight-bearing joints due hemophilic arthropathy and associated muscle atrophy thus the correct management individual hemarthroses childhood considerable importance and the present time too little known the best possible treatment for these episodes little known the pathological mechanisms hemophilic arthropathy and whether the presence blood its presence under tension which leads joint destruction thus opinions differ concerning the routine admission all hemarthroses hospital regardless severity and also about the advisability joint aspiration attempt avoid the development destructive arthropathy because the individual variation between patients the changes the pattern the disease with age and the difficulty obtaining suitable control patients these questions can answered only further longterm prospective medicosocial studies
